Create an empty blank single page iOS application.
Now delete Main.Storyboard and RootViewController.
Also delete/ clear info present in Info.Plist file --> Deployment Info section --> Main Interface
keep this section blank.

Now in AppDelegate.cs file
in FinishedLaunching method
create a window, then a UIViewController and a UINavigationController
set UIViewController as a RootViewController as following :

public override bool FinishedLaunching(UIApplication application, NSDictionary launchOptions)
        {
            // Override point for customization after application launch.
            // If not required for your application you can safely delete this method

            Window = new UIWindow(UIScreen.MainScreen.Bounds);

            var controller = new UIViewController();
            controller.View.BackgroundColor = UIColor.Gray;
            controller.Title = "My First Controller";

            var navController = new UINavigationController(controller);

            Window.RootViewController = navController;

            Window.MakeKeyAndVisible();

            return true;
        }

This is how to create a app Ui with code in xamarin.iOS
